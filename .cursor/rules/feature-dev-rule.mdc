# EconomicsGame2 Full Development Process

## Planning Phase
1. **User provides general idea** - User describes a feature concept in broad terms
2. **Create plan document** - Assistant creates `docs/wip/FeatureName.md` with sections:
   - **Overview**: High-level description of the feature and its purpose
   - **Tech Spec**: Technical specifications including components, systems, and configuration
   - **Steps To Implement Checklist**: Detailed implementation phases with checkboxes
3. **Iterative refinement** - User provides feedback on each section, assistant updates document
4. **Final plan approval** - User approves the complete plan document
5. **Commit Changes**: Commit all changes after completing a phase with descriptive commit message

## Implementation Phase
When working through implementation phases from plan documents:

1. **Complete Phase Steps**: Implement all tasks in the current phase
2. **Wait for Feedback**: After completing a phase, wait for user feedback before proceeding
3. **Mark Completed Steps**: Update the checklist by marking completed steps with [x]
4. **Handle Corrections**: If user feedback indicates issues or changes needed:
   - Add new checklist items with "Fix:" prefix and brief description
   - Example: "- [ ] Fix: Adjust probability calculation in ItemGenerationProcessingSystem"
5. **Proceed to Next Phase**: Only move to the next phase after user approval of current phase
6. **Document Progress**: Update TODO.md when features are completed
7. **Commit Changes**: Commit all changes after completing a phase with descriptive commit message

This workflow ensures iterative development with proper feedback loops and clear tracking of progress and corrections.
