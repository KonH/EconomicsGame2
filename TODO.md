# Dev Progress

## Overview

Here I try to keep track of the development.
It could be useful to have a clear overview of what has been done and what is still to be done.

Also, it is maybe useful in combining with modern AI/LLM tools — it is an experiment for now.

## Tasks

- **Dev experience**
  - [ ] Set up Rider + Copilot (minimal rules)
  - [ ] Set up Cursor (Unity support and minimal rules)
